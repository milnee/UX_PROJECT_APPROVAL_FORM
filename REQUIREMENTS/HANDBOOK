Welcome
Welcome
Welcome to the UX Design Module (COM321)!
In this module, you'll explore the exciting world of User Experience (UX) design, learning how to
create products that are useful, intuitive, and engaging. Throughout the semester, we’ll cover core
web and mobile development skills using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and TypeScript, all while
keeping user needs and expectations at the forefront of our designs.
With a mix of lectures, practical sessions, and independent study, you'll build dynamic web
applications, critically evaluate user interfaces, and gain hands-on experience in front-end
development. This module will set a strong foundation for future web development, blending technical
skills with a deep understanding of user-centered design.
We look forward to seeing the innovative applications you create!
Kind regards
